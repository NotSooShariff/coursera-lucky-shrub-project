# Coursera Meta Frontend Developer Certification Coursework 🌱

This is a personal GitHub repository for the Coursera Meta Frontend Developer Certification coursework. This repository contains my final project, which is a peer-reviewed assignment I completed as part of the certification program. 📚

## Project Overview 🌼

This project is based on a fictional company called "Lucky Shrub," which is a garden design firm. The goal of this project was to create a portfolio website for Lucky Shrub, showcasing their services, previous projects, and contact information. Apologies for the somewhat "shabby" nature of this repository. It's been a while since I've had to write vanilla HTML and CSS, and I'm well aware that it might be a bit rusty xD. 

## Contents 📦
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the portfolio website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file used to style the website.

## Usage 🛠️

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference or inspiration for your own projects.

## Live Demo 🚀
